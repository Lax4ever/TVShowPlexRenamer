README

Very basic program. Used to rename TV Show video files to a format that is friendly for the Plex Media Server.

Please be aware of the following:

1) Make sure your episodes are already seperated by season
2) Each season folder should only have the episode video files and their sub files
3) Each episode, at this time, can only have one sub file.
